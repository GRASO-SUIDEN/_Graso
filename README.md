**Notes:**

- Graso is currently a prototype of the actual idea, meaning we are making it as accessible to everyone.
- Property listing will only be accessible to verified real estate developers after launch.
- We are looking to request more information from real estate developers after launch.
- We will add security measures to ensure that every property listed is verified, and 100% safe for investment.
- We would love feedback from you.
